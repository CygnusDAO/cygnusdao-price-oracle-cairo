We make use of Empiric Network price feeds to bring one of the most accurate and reliable oracles in DeFi yet.

Empiric Network is a decentralized, transparent and composable oracle network, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-knowledge cryptography. They partner with the biggest market makers and the most liquid exchanges who sign and timestamp their own high quality, robust data and send it directly on-chain. Their feeds are already live in public alpha on Starknet, where they are powering the next generation of ambitious protocols such as ZKLend, CurveZero, Magnety, Canvas, FujiDAO and more. Learn more about them [here](https://empiric.network/).
